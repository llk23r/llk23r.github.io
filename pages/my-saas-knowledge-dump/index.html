Itâ€™s a necessary evil which rarely spawns out of the blue, itâ€™s that monster that has been watching you ignore it in plain sight while you engineer away your product without ever considering that one day you might have to migrate a lot of real customer data and every record and every boolean field counts.

A lot of engineering boils down to anticipating what could break and trying to proactively prevent the breaking. In this anticipation, you will end up falling into whatâ€™s best and whatâ€™s better than what and all sorts of opinion.
